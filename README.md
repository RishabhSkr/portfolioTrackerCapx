## ‚ö†Ô∏è Assumptions and Limitations

Please note the following assumptions and limitations for the demo version of the CapX application:

1. **One Stock Only**: For demo purposes, you can add only one stock, with a quantity set to 1. This is to keep the demo simple and focused on showcasing core functionality.
  
2. **No Authentication**: As per the Task assigned the application currently supports only one user and does not include authentication. This is solely for demo purposes, and user management will be implemented in future versions.

3. **Simplified UI**: The user interface is intentionally kept simple and clear to provide a better understanding of the functionality. A more visually attractive design will be added later without compromising usability.

We appreciate your understanding as we continue to enhance the platform! üöÄ
